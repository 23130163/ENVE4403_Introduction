    "This tutorial will introduce you to the basics of working with oceanographic data in Python. We will use the [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) package to work with data in the form of comma-separated values (CSV) files, and the [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) package to work with data in the form of NetCDF files. We will also use the [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) package to plot our data.\n",

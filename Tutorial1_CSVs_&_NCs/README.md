## CSV's and NetCDF's

This tutorial will introduce you to the basics of working with oceanographic data in Python. We will use the [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) package to work with data in the form of comma-separated values (CSV) files, and the [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) package to work with data in the form of NetCDF files. We will also use the [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) package to plot our data.

### CSV files
CSV files are a common way to store data in a text format. They are easy to read and write, and can be opened in a text editor or spreadsheet program. CSV files are also easy to work with in Python, and Pandas provides a number of functions to read and write CSV files.
